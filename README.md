# FoodTruck

Overview
The user is initially asked to input information for a food truck (Name, Food Type, Rating).
The code will loop for up to 5 food trucks, or stop asking for trucks if the user types "quit" in the
name field.
The information that is gathered in an array is inputted into the FoodTruck class. That information is then able to be referenced in the later menu method. The user is then prompted to choose out of 4 options. Options 1-3 will compile the requested information to determine the list of all the trucks, average rating and the highest rated truck. Option 4 will quit the program.

Technologies Used

Java

Lessons Learned
My biggest issue was determining how to reference the required information for the menu options. I was not initially familiar with the "get/set" concept. Once it was explained to me more i was able to code properly to achieve the proper information.
I was also confused as to why i had to create an instance of the FooTruckApplication (ftAPP) within the code itself.  and then also use that instance to call other methods. I am still a bit hazy on the exact reason for that.
i am happy to see the concepts of what we have learned so far slowly manifest itself into real world applicability.
